# TickerInsight
TickerInsight is a dashboard designed to help users make informed investment decisions.

## Inspiration
When I opened my first investment account, I was head-over-heels with emotion. I couldn't wait to start buying and selling stocks of the worlds most renown companies. 

However, before I knew it, I had lost fifteen percent of my investment. Instead of blindly clicking buy and sell, I needed to make sure that my investment decisions were evidence-backed.

To solve this problem, I did what any one would do: I opened Google. I was bombarded by a list of expensive results from the worlds top financial institutions, and as I scrolled through what each of these institutions offered to their clients, I thought:

What if I could make a free application to help users make informed investment decisions that catered to the average investor, like myself?
